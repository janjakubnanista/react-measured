# react-measured

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/janjakubnanista/react-width-height.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/janjakubnanista/react-measured)

Zero-dependency `React` bounding box providers and hooks for React.

## Installation

`react-measured` is available as an NPM module (along with its TypeScript definitions):

```bash
# For npm users
npm install --save react-measured

# For yarn users
yarn add react-measured
```

**IMPORTANT** `react-measured` provides core functionality for bounding box providers.
You most probably don't want to use it directly. If you are developing a browser based React app
you might want to check out [`react-measured-dom`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-measured-dom). For native development [`react-measured-native`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-measured-dom) package will soon be available for production use.
